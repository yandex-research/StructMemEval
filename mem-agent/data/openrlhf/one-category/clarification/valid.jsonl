[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags. In between these tags, the user might provide verbal filter(s) that may be inclusive or exclusive, you HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THESE FILTERS. These filters provide privacy over user information.

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags.

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags.

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags. In between these tags, the user might provide verbal filter(s) that may be inclusive or exclusive, you HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THESE FILTERS. These filters provide privacy over user information.

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags. In between these tags, the user might provide verbal filter(s) that may be inclusive or exclusive, you HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THESE FILTERS. These filters provide privacy over user information.

It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags.

[[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory.\n\n## Filtering\n\nIn the user query, you might receive a fact-retrieval question that incudes <filter> tags. In between these tags, the user might provide verbal filter(s) that may be inclusive or exclusive, you HAVE TO ABSOLUTELY FOLLOW THESE FILTERS. These filters provide privacy over user information. If there are no filters, just return the answer as is."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Is it true that Susan Carter has been our cashier for 10 years now?"}], "label": "clarification\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nmemory_bc74ce0890e443f8809a73fa842e2928\n\n~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~/~\n\nI have Susan listed with 5 years of experience, not 10.

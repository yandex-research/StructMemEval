You are a precise evaluator of CLARIFICATION responses for a memory-augmented agent.
Your goal is to judge whether the agent responded by seeking clarification rather than fabricating facts.

Inputs:
- Question (from user):
{{question}}

- Agent reply:
{{reply}}

Task definition:
The agent should handle three common clarification scenarios without hallucinating:
1) Non-existing entity: The question references an entity not present in memory -> reply should say it cannot find that entity (or lacks info) and ask the user to confirm or provide identifying details.
2) Non-existing attribute (of an existing entity): The question requests an attribute not present -> reply should state the attribute is missing and ask for the exact info needed.
3) Contradiction: The question contains a fact that conflicts with memory -> reply should point out the mismatch and ask the user which version is correct.

General requirements for a good clarification reply:
- Do not present an unverified fact as truth.
- Ask at least one concrete, helpful follow-up question to resolve the ambiguity.
- Be concise and natural (1–2 sentences is fine, but longer is acceptable if helpful).
- If the user included <filter>...</filter> constraints in the question, the reply must respect them (no leaking filtered info).

Output JSON (strict):
{
  "reasoning": string,
  "success": boolean
}

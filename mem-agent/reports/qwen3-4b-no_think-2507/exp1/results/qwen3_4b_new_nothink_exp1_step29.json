It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

      "reasoning": "1.  **Relevance to the question:** The answer is highly relevant. It directly addresses the primary question of \"how long\" by stating \"You have 5 years\". It then goes a step further by providing relevant advice on the \"party planning\" aspect of the question, which is helpful context.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information:** The answer is accurate. It correctly states the user has 5 years, which aligns with the provided correct answer. The planning advice (starting 12-18 months in advance) is a reasonable and standard recommendation for a large event like a 50th birthday party.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response:** The response is very complete. It not only provides the direct answer (5 years) but also anticipates the user's underlying need for planning guidance. By suggesting a specific timeframe to start organizing (12-18 months) and listing key tasks (venue, guests, catering), it provides a more comprehensive and useful response than the bare-bones correct answer.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content:** The answer explicitly states, \"Since you're currently at age 45,\" which demonstrates it has correctly used information from the conversation memory to calculate the 5-year timeframe.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The judging preference is empty. In this case, the evaluation is based on general quality. The assistant's answer is of high quality because it is accurate, complete, and helpful.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

The answer is highly relevant.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information**: The answer correctly pulls the user's background from memory (Investment Banking Director, economics education from Moscow State University and London Business School), which aligns with the details mentioned in the judging preference (Economics degree, MBA, Director role). The career suggestions are plausible and accurate for someone with this profile.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response**: The answer provides both direct career transitions and alternative paths, offering a good breadth of options. It also includes a brief rationale, making the response reasonably complete.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content**: The answer is built entirely upon the user's background, which is presumed to be in the conversation memory. The personalization demonstrates successful retrieval and use of memory content.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference**:\n    *   **Infer transferable skills**: The answer correctly infers the user's skills by stating that the suggested roles \"directly leverage your existing expertise in finance and economics\" and offer \"continuity with your current skills\". While it doesn't explicitly list \"analytical\" or \"leadership\" skills, this phrasing effectively communicates the same idea.\n    *   **Suggest specific fields**: The judging preference explicitly calls for suggestions like \"strategic consulting or corporate finance (CFO)\". The assistant's answer directly suggests \"Chief Financial Officer (CFO)\" as a primary option. This is a perfect match.\n    *   **Justify the fit**: The answer justifies the suggestions by mentioning that they leverage existing expertise and offer growth potential. This fulfills the requirement for a brief justification.\n\nOverall, the answer aligns very well with the judging preference. It uses the user's background to suggest one of the exact roles (CFO) mentioned in the preference and provides a logical, albeit brief, justification for why these roles would be a good fit. It successfully performs the core task outlined in the preference.",

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

Since no specific gift preferences were mentioned, I'll focus on ideas that naturally emerge from her interests and personal details.\n<python></python>\n<reply>\nHere are some personalized birthday gift ideas for your roommate, Maya Chen, based on her interests and lifestyle:\n\n1. **Photo Journaling Kit with a San Francisco Theme**  \n   Since Maya enjoys urban photography, a photo journaling kit with a San Francisco theme would be perfect. Include items like a leather-bound notebook, a small camera bag, and a set of stickers featuring iconic SF landmarks (like the Golden Gate Bridge or Alcatraz). Add a personal note suggesting she document her favorite \"urban moments\" throughout the city.\n\n2. **Climbing Gear for Her Next Adventure**  \n   Given her passion for rock climbing, consider a beginner-friendly climbing kit. This could include a climbing harness, a chalk bag, and a small climbing chalk. Add a fun twist by including a \"climb challenge\" card with a list of local climbing spots in SF, such as the Golden Gate Bridge or the cliffs at the Presidio.\n\n3. **Ramen Spot Experience Passport**  \n   Since she loves trying new ramen spots, create a \"Ramen Spot Experience Passport\" with a map of top ramen shops in San Francisco. Include QR codes that link to reviews or photos of each spot. You could even add a small prize (like a discount coupon) for completing the passport. This would make it a fun and interactive gift.\n\n4. **Boba the Corgi-Themed Gift Set**  \n   Since she has a Corgi named Boba, a personalized gift set featuring Boba could be both fun and meaningful. Include a custom photo frame with a photo of Boba, a cozy dog bed, and a set of dog treats with a playful \"Boba\u2019s Daily Adventures\" label. Add a note saying, \"Happy Birthday, Boba \u2014 you're the best part of Maya\u2019s day!\"\n\n5. **Personalized UX Design Tool Kit**  \n   As a senior UX designer, she might appreciate a tool kit tailored to her work. This could include a high-quality Figma or Sketch starter pack, a set of design mood boards, or a personalized notebook with UX design prompts. Include a note saying, \"Happy Birthday to the designer who turns ideas into beautiful experiences!\"\n\n6. **\"Project Odyssey\" Birthday Bonus**  \n   Since she's working on \"Project Odyssey,\" consider a small gift tied to her work. For example, a custom-designed wireframe or prototype of a feature for her app, or a personalized \"design challenge\" card with a fun prompt like \"Redesign the login screen to be more intuitive.\" This would show you\u2019ve paid attention to her professional life.\n\nThese gifts are thoughtfully curated to reflect Maya\u2019s passions, lifestyle, and personal details. They go beyond generic presents and show that you\u2019ve taken time to understand her world \u2014 from her love of photography and climbing to her bond with Boba and her work as a UX designer.  \n</reply>"

The judging preference provides specific details about this roommate: her name is Chloe, she is a freelance portrait and event photographer, she enjoys film festivals, local cafes, and hiking, and they share a Corgi named Boba.\n\nThe assistant's answer is fundamentally flawed because it creates a completely different persona for the roommate. It fabricates a roommate named \"Maya Chen\" with a different profession (Senior UX Designer) and different interests (urban photography, rock climbing, ramen spots).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the inconsistencies:\n\n1.  **Name:** The answer uses \"Maya Chen\" instead of the correct name, \"Chloe\".\n2.  **Occupation:** The answer states the roommate is a \"senior UX designer\" and even mentions a specific project (\"Project Odyssey\"). This directly contradicts the provided information that Chloe is a \"Freelance Photographer\" specializing in portraits and events.\n3.  **Interests:** The gift suggestions are based on incorrect interests like \"urban photography,\" \"rock climbing,\" and \"ramen spots.\" Chloe's actual interests are \"film festivals,\" \"exploring local cafes,\" and \"hiking.\" While there's a slight thematic overlap with photography, the specifics are completely wrong and not tailored to Chloe's specialization (portraits/events) or her other hobbies.\n4.  **Shared Pet:** This is the only point of partial consistency. The answer correctly identifies the Corgi's name as \"Boba.\" However, it frames the gift around \"Maya's\" relationship with the dog, not the shared co-parenting dynamic with Chloe mentioned in the judging preference.\n\nIn essence, the assistant failed to retrieve and use the specific, crucial information provided in the memory/judging preference. Instead of personalizing the gift ideas for Chloe, it hallucinated a different person entirely, making all the \"personalized\" suggestions irrelevant and incorrect for the user's actual situation.

It must identify that Liam O'Hara is a Lead Product Manager, whose role involves product roadmapping and market analysis, making him ideal for feedback on narrative and stakeholder communication. It should also recognize that David Lee, as a Lead Engineer, would be better suited for feedback on technical accuracy, not necessarily the presentation's story or business impact. The model should conclude that Liam is the better choice for this specific request.",
      "reasoning": "The user's question is subjective, asking for an opinion on whom to ask for feedback on a presentation narrative. The judging preference outlines the ideal structure and content for this subjective answer, requiring it to be based on facts from an implied knowledge base about the roles of two individuals, Liam and David.\n\n1.  **Relevance to the question**: The answer directly addresses the question by recommending Liam and explaining why he is the better choice for the specific task of reviewing a presentation's narrative.\n2.  **Accuracy of information**: The answer correctly identifies Liam as the Lead Product Manager. It accurately infers that his role involves a strategic overview, which is consistent with the duties of a product manager. It also correctly infers that David's role is technical, focusing on implementation details rather than the narrative. This aligns with the judging preference's description of David as a Lead Engineer.\n3.  **Completeness of the response**: The response is complete. It not only provides a direct answer (Liam) but also a comparative analysis of why Liam is more suitable than David for this particular request. It explains Liam's strengths (strategic overview, stakeholder alignment) and contrasts them with David's focus (technical aspects), which makes the recommendation well-rounded and justified.\n4.  **Consistency with memory content**: The answer leverages the distinct roles of the two individuals, which are presumed to be stored in the memory/knowledge base. The reasoning (Product Manager for strategy/narrative, Engineer for technicals) is consistent with the roles specified in the judging preference (Lead Product Manager vs. Lead Engineer).\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference**: The answer successfully adheres to all key points of the judging preference:\n    *   It makes a subjective choice (Liam) based on factual roles.\n    *   It compares the roles of the two colleagues.\n    *   It identifies Liam's role as a \"Lead Product Manager\" and correctly links his responsibilities (\"strategic overview of the project's goals, narrative, and stakeholder alignment\") to the user's need for feedback on a \"compelling narrative.\"\n    *   It recognizes David's focus is on technical aspects, making him less suitable for narrative feedback.\n    *   It concludes that Liam is the better choice.\n\nThe answer is a textbook example of what the judging preference asked for.

This is a much more helpful and agentic response that actively works to solve the user's problem.\n\nWhile saving the intent to memory is a valid agentic action, it should not be the *only* action. The primary goal should be to assist the user with their immediate request, and that requires clarification. The assistant's response is passive and unhelpful in the immediate context of the conversation.",

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

It even provides additional context by mentioning what information *is* in the maintenance log (furnace filter replacement), which demonstrates it has correctly consulted its memory.\n\nHowever, the evaluation must be based on the judging preference: \"Model should clarify ambiguity.\" In this context, the \"ambiguity\" is the missing information in the assistant's knowledge base.

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

It begins by stating, \"I cannot confirm the availability of the resource room...\" and then explains why: \"...there is no recorded information about the resource room's availability or scheduling in the current memory system.\" This is a clear and direct statement of its limitations, fully satisfying this part of the preference.\n\n2.  **Offer alternative assistance:** The assistant also succeeds here. It provides a direct and actionable alternative for the user: \"You may need to check directly with the school's resource booking system at https://northwood.schoolportal.edu/resources or contact your school administration for confirmation.\" This gives the user a clear path forward.\n\n**Comparison to the Correct Answer:**\n*   The assistant's answer is very similar in substance to the correct answer. Both identify the limitation and provide the correct URL.\n*   The correct answer offers more proactive assistance (\"Would you like me to remind you to check...?\"), which is slightly better, but the assistant's answer still provides valid \"alternative assistance\" as required by the judging preference.\n*   The assistant's answer includes some slightly irrelevant information pulled from memory (\"While your AP Lit unit is scheduled and you'll need large-text versions of poems...\"). This makes the response a little less concise than the ideal answer, but it does not make it incorrect. It shows the model is trying to be context-aware, even if the connection it makes isn't perfectly relevant to the immediate task.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe assistant's answer successfully adheres to both parts of the judging preference. It clearly states what it cannot do and why, and it provides concrete, helpful alternatives for the user.

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

However, there is no explicit mention of the current store credit balance in the file.\n\n2. **Wireless Mouse Return**:\n   - The user ordered a wireless mouse (ORD-97150 on 2024-08-05) and later filed a return request (TKT-10800 on 2024-11-20) for it. The ticket status is \"Open,\" indicating the return process is still pending and no resolution or credit assignment has been confirmed yet.\n\nSince no specific store credit balance value is available in the file, and the return status is still open, I will provide a clear and honest response to the user.\n\n<python></python>\n\n<reply>\nBased on your stored information, here's what I found:\n\n- **Store Credit Balance**: There is no current store credit balance recorded in your profile. You did request store credit for the wireless mouse return (Ticket ID: TKT-10800), but the request is still open and no balance has been assigned yet.\n\n- **Wireless Mouse Return**: You returned the wireless mouse (Order ID: ORD-97150) on 2024-08-05. A return request was submitted on 2024-11-20, and the status is currently \"Open,\" meaning the store has not yet processed or confirmed the return or credited your account.\n\nI recommend contacting customer support directly to confirm the status of your return and store credit request.\n</reply>",

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

This, combined with the provided \"correct answer\" (\"You have 0 9V batteries remaining...\"), implies that the assistant was expected to have access to a memory state/file that contains this inventory information.\n\nThe assistant's answer, however, completely fails to access this information. It claims, \"I don't have information about your supply inventory... There is no file in the system that tracks inventory\". This is a direct contradiction of the task's premise.\n\n1.  **Relevance to the question**: The answer is relevant because it directly addresses the user's query about 9V batteries.\n2.  **Accuracy of information**: The answer is inaccurate. The correct answer is \"0\". The assistant's response that it \"cannot determine\" the number is factually incorrect according to the expected state.\n3.  **Completeness of the response**: While the answer explains *why* it cannot provide the number, it is fundamentally incomplete because it fails to fulfill the user's primary request based on the available information.\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content**: The assistant's response is inconsistent with the expected memory state. The premise of the evaluation is that this information exists. The assistant's failure to find or use this information represents a failure in its agentic capability.\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference**: The answer directly violates the judging preference. It was supposed to \"correctly reflect the current state of the... battery inventory,\" but instead, it denied the existence of such a state.\n\nIn summary, the assistant failed its core task. Instead of retrieving the correct information from its memory (which should have indicated 0 batteries), it gave a generic response claiming no information was available.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

Either provide more Python code OR empty `<python></python>` with a `<reply>`\n\n**Understanding Results:**\n- `{'variable_name': value}` - Your assigned variables and their values\n- `{}` - Empty dict means NO variables were assigned (you forgot to capture return values!)\n- If you get `{}`, your function calls weren't assigned to variables\n\n## Memory API\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL: ALWAYS assign function results to variables or they will be LOST!**\n```python\n# CORRECT - Results are captured\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\n\n# WRONG - Results are lost, you get empty {}\ncheck_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\nread_file(\"user.md\")\n```\n\n```python\n# File Operations\ncreate_file(file_path: str, content: str = \"\") -> bool  # Auto-creates parent directories\nupdate_file(file_path: str, old_content: str, new_content: str) -> Union[bool, str] # Returns True or error message\nread_file(file_path: str) -> str\ndelete_file(file_path: str) -> bool\ncheck_if_file_exists(file_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Directory Operations\ncreate_dir(dir_path: str) -> bool\nlist_files() -> str  # Shows tree structure of current working directory\ncheck_if_dir_exists(dir_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Utilities\nget_size(file_or_dir_path: str) -> int  # Bytes; empty = total memory size\ngo_to_link(link_string: str) -> bool\n```\n\n## File Update Examples\n\n### Adding to a table:\n```python\n# Find the last row and add new row after it\nold_content = \"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\n| 2024-03-20 | Added Family    | Active   |\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n# ALWAYS check the result!\nif result != True:\n  # Handle the error - result contains the error message\n  print(f\"Update failed: {result}\")\n\nAppending a new section:\n\n# Find the last line of a section and append after it\nold_content = \"- favorite_color: blue\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"- favorite_color: blue\n- favorite_food: pizza\n- favorite_movie: Inception\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nAppending to a list:\n\n# Add a new item to an existing list\nold_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\"\"\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\n- photography\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nUpdating a fact:\n\nold_content = \"- user_age: 25\"\nnew_content = \"- user_age: 26\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n## Memory Structure\n\n### Root Directory\n- `user.md`: Personal information & attributes about the user, plus relationships to other entities\n- `entities/`: Information about people, places, organizations, etc.\n  - `[entity_name].md`: One file per entity\n\n### File Conventions\n- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format\n- File names: snake_case, no spaces\n- All files use .md extension\n- New sections in files start with ## headers\n- Facts stored as: `- fact_name: fact_value`\n- Cross-references: Use `[[entity_name]]` to link between entities\n\n### user.md Structure\n```markdown\n# User Information\n- user_name: [name]\n- user_age: [age]\n- [other attributes]\n\n## User Relationships\n- wife: [[entities/jane_doe.md]]\n- friend: [[entities/john_smith.md]]\n- employer: [[entities/google.md]]\n\n## Any other relation\n- name of entity: Explanation of what markdown files stores. [[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

      "judge": "Answer should contain the right information",
      "reasoning": "1.  **Relevance to the question:** The answer is relevant as it directly addresses the user's question about their refrigerator model.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information:** The answer correctly identifies the refrigerator make and model (GE GNE25JMKES), which aligns with the correct answer. However, it introduces several additional pieces of information that are not present in the correct answer and are likely fabricated:\n    *   The specific installation date (\"today\").\n    *   A list of marketing features (\"energy efficiency, smart temperature control, and a spacious door design\").\n    *   Information about the old refrigerator (\"replaces your old Samsung refrigerator\").\n    While the core requested information is accurate, the addition of these unverified and likely hallucinated details makes the overall answer inaccurate.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response:** The answer provides the key information requested. It is more than complete, but this is a negative in this case, as the extra information is not grounded in the source data (as represented by the correct answer). It also omits the context that the information came from a maintenance log, which is a useful detail from the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content:** Based on the provided correct answer (which serves as a proxy for the memory content), the assistant's answer is inconsistent. It includes details about features and the old model that are not mentioned in the correct answer, suggesting it is not strictly adhering to the user's memory but is instead embellishing the response.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The preference is \"Answer should contain the right information\". The assistant's answer contains a mix of right and likely wrong (or at least, unverified) information. By adding fabricated details, it fails to meet the standard of providing only \"the right information\". The pollution of the correct fact with speculation and embellishment makes the answer unreliable.\n\nIn summary, while the assistant successfully retrieved the correct model number, it undermined its credibility by adding several unrequested and unverified details, which violates the core judging preference of providing the right information.",

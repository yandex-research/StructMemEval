[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

However, the premise for its explanation (no information available) is false.\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content:** The answer is inconsistent with the memory content that is implied by the \"CORRECT answer\" field. The assistant failed to access or correctly report the information that was supposed to be in its memory.\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The judging preference is empty.\n\nIn summary, the assistant failed its primary task, which was to retrieve a specific piece of information from its memory. Instead of providing the correct occupation, it incorrectly reported that no information was available. Therefore, the answer is incorrect.",

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

      "reasoning": "1.  **Relevance to the question:** The answer is highly relevant. It directly addresses the question in the first sentence by stating, \"You have 5 years until your 50th birthday.\" It then correctly interprets the user's likely underlying intent\u2014which is not just about the total time, but about a practical planning timeline\u2014and provides helpful advice on when to start the actual planning process.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information:** The core information is accurate. It correctly states the user has 5 years until their 50th birthday, which aligns with the provided \"correct answer.\" The reference to the user's current age of 45 indicates it has correctly used information from memory to perform the calculation (50 - 45 = 5). The planning advice (starting 6 months ahead, checklist of tasks) is standard, practical, and accurate for event planning.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response:** The response is more complete and helpful than the simple \"correct answer.\" While the correct answer is literally true, the assistant's answer is much more useful. It provides the literal answer and then adds actionable advice, including a recommended start time for planning and a checklist of key tasks. This demonstrates a better understanding of the user's needs.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content:** The answer explicitly states, \"Since your current age is 45,\" which shows it correctly retrieved and used information from the conversation memory to calculate the 5-year timeframe. This is a perfect use of memory context.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The judging preference is empty. In such cases, the evaluation defaults to general quality metrics like helpfulness, accuracy, and completeness.

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

The presence of specific details like \"Innovatech Solutions\" and \"Project Odyssey\" supports this. The core information (the skills) matches the provided correct answer, which is presumed to be derived from the same memory.\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The judging preference is empty. In this case, the evaluation relies on general principles of a good conversational assistant. The assistant's answer is accurate, relevant, complete, and provides useful, contextual information without being overly verbose. It fulfills the user's request effectively.\n\nIn summary, the assistant provides a perfect answer. It correctly identifies the requested information, presents it clearly, and adds relevant context that enhances the user's understanding.",

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

It must identify that Liam O'Hara is a Lead Product Manager, whose role involves product roadmapping and market analysis, making him ideal for feedback on narrative and stakeholder communication.

The judging preference sets clear criteria for a good answer: it must use facts from the knowledge base to compare the roles of Liam and David, identify their specific job titles and responsibilities, and conclude that Liam is the better choice for narrative feedback due to his strategic role, while David is better for technical feedback.\n\nThe assistant's answer successfully meets these criteria.\n\n1.  **Relevance and Conclusion:** The answer directly addresses the question, starting with a clear recommendation: \"Liam would be better to ask for feedback.\" This aligns with the required conclusion.\n2.  **Comparison and Role Identification:** The answer provides a direct comparison between the two individuals.\n    *   It correctly identifies Liam as the \"Lead Product Manager\" and correctly deduces that his role involves \"strategic direction and stakeholder alignment,\" which is synonymous with the \"product roadmapping and market analysis\" mentioned in the preference. This makes him the ideal person for feedback on a \"compelling narrative.\"\n    *   While it doesn't explicitly state David's title as \"Lead Engineer,\" it accurately describes his function as focusing on \"technical accuracy\" and \"implementation details,\" which perfectly aligns with the preference's description of his role.\n3.  **Justification:** The reasoning provided is sound and consistent with the judging preference. It explains *why* Liam is the better choice (his focus on strategy and business goals) and *why* David is less suitable for this specific task (his focus on technical implementation, not storytelling).\n\nThe answer is a concise and accurate application of the knowledge base facts to a subjective question, fulfilling all the requirements outlined in the judging preference.",

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

      "reasoning": "1.  **Relevance to the question**: The answer is highly relevant. It directly addresses the user's question by stating that the requested information (last roof inspection date) is not available in its records.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information**: The answer accurately reflects the state of the available memory (which can be inferred from the response). It correctly states that the roof inspection date is not recorded and accurately quotes the information that *is* present in the maintenance log (furnace filter replacement).\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response**: The response is complete and helpful. It doesn't just say \"I don't know.\" Instead, it explains what it checked (the maintenance log), what it found (only a furnace filter replacement), confirms the absence of the requested data, and proactively offers to add the information if the user provides it. This is very comprehensive.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content**: The answer is consistent with the implied memory content. The details provided (address, furnace filter replacement date) suggest the model correctly parsed its memory and found no mention of a roof inspection.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference**: The judging preference is \"Model should clarify ambiguity.\" The model excels here. The ambiguity is the lack of information. Instead of giving a simple \"I don't know,\" the model clarifies the situation by:\n    a. Stating what information source it checked (\"The maintenance log for 452 Willow Creek Dr\").\n    b. Explaining what that source contains (\"only includes a furnace filter replacement on August 5, 2024\").\n    c. Explicitly confirming the absence of the requested data (\"there is no mention of a roof inspection\").\n    d. Offering a clear path to resolve the ambiguity for the future (\"If you have additional details or would like to add this information, I can help update the records.\").\nThis approach is almost identical in function and quality to the provided correct answer.

The assistant does not ask for clarification on the video. It states that the user hasn't provided metrics, which partially addresses the second part (\"ask for the missing performance data\"), but it's framed more as a statement of fact than a collaborative request for the data. The offer to set up a new system is a proactive suggestion, but it sidesteps the immediate need to identify the content in question.\n\nIn summary, the assistant correctly identifies that it lacks the data but fails to perform the crucial step of asking for clarification on the ambiguous subject (\"the CreativeBoost video\").

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

The correct answer provides a perfect example of what it should have done: acknowledge the limitation and then offer to help with a related task it *can* do, like preparing an agenda.\n3.  **Accuracy:** The information presented is entirely fabricated.

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

It explicitly states, \"There is no direct information about specific creative assets (such as images, videos, or designs) in the memory system\" and \"the specific creative assets for the holiday campaign are not documented.\" This clearly communicates its limitation \u2013 it cannot \"pull up\" the assets because they are not in its memory. This fulfills the first part of the preference.\n\n2.  **Offer alternative ways to help organize the assets:** The assistant excels here. Instead of just stopping at \"I can't do that,\" it offers several highly relevant and actionable alternatives derived from the context in its memory.\n    *   It provides a summary of the project's status, which is a helpful way to re-orient the user.\n    *   It recommends scheduling a meeting with the vendor, \"CreativeBoost Agency,\" which is a direct and proactive step toward getting the assets. This is a great example of agentic behavior.\n    *   It offers to create a new entity for the vendor, which would help in organizing information related to them in the future.\n    *   It offers to \"assist with any other aspects of the holiday campaign planning.\"\n\nThe assistant's response is superior to the \"correct answer\" because it leverages more specific information from the memory (like the vendor's name) to provide more tailored and actionable suggestions. It goes beyond just \"organizing\" and helps with the entire task of *obtaining and managing* the assets.

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team.

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

The provided \"correct answer\" indicates that the model's memory *does* contain information about this folder (it exists, its path is `/Modernist_Poetry/`, and it's related to an upcoming AP Lit unit), but that it lacks information about the specific *contents* of the folder.\n\nThe assistant's answer, however, is a direct contradiction to this known information.\n\n1.  **Relevance to the question**: The answer is relevant as it directly addresses the \"Modernist Poetry folder\".\n2.  **Accuracy of information**: The answer is factually inaccurate. It claims \"The 'Modernist Poetry' folder does not exist in your memory system.\" This is false, according to the context provided by the \"correct answer\". The model should have been aware of the folder's existence.\n3.  **Completeness of the response**: The response is a dead-end. It provides incorrect information and does not offer any further assistance or clarification. The correct answer, in contrast, clarifies the situation and offers to help.\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content**: The answer is completely inconsistent with the memory content implied by the \"correct answer\". The model should know the folder exists.\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference**: The answer fails to adhere to the judging preference, which is to \"clarify what information it has versus what it would need to access.\" Instead of clarifying what it knows (the folder exists, its purpose) and what it doesn't know (the contents), it incorrectly claims to know nothing at all. It does not distinguish between the folder's existence and the folder's contents, leading to a factually wrong and unhelpful response.\n\nIn summary, the assistant's answer is inaccurate, unhelpful, and directly violates the judging preference by failing to properly report on the information it possesses.",

Missing </think>, </python>, or </reply> will cause errors!**\n\n**NEVER:**\n- Skip the `<think>` block\n- Provide text outside of these tags\n- Use `<reply>` when you have Python code in `<python>`\n- Respond with plain text after receiving `<result>` blocks\n\n## After Receiving `<result>` Blocks\n\nWhen you receive `<result>` blocks, you MUST:\n1. Start a new response with `<think>`\n2. Analyze the results and decide if more memory operations are needed\n3. Either provide more Python code OR empty `<python></python>` with a `<reply>`\n\n**Understanding Results:**\n- `{'variable_name': value}` - Your assigned variables and their values\n- `{}` - Empty dict means NO variables were assigned (you forgot to capture return values!)\n- If you get `{}`, your function calls weren't assigned to variables\n\n## Memory API\n\n**\u26a0\ufe0f CRITICAL: ALWAYS assign function results to variables or they will be LOST!**\n```python\n# CORRECT - Results are captured\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\n\n# WRONG - Results are lost, you get empty {}\ncheck_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\nread_file(\"user.md\")\n```\n\n```python\n# File Operations\ncreate_file(file_path: str, content: str = \"\") -> bool  # Auto-creates parent directories\nupdate_file(file_path: str, old_content: str, new_content: str) -> Union[bool, str] # Returns True or error message\nread_file(file_path: str) -> str\ndelete_file(file_path: str) -> bool\ncheck_if_file_exists(file_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Directory Operations\ncreate_dir(dir_path: str) -> bool\nlist_files() -> str  # Shows tree structure of current working directory\ncheck_if_dir_exists(dir_path: str) -> bool\n\n# Utilities\nget_size(file_or_dir_path: str) -> int  # Bytes; empty = total memory size\ngo_to_link(link_string: str) -> bool\n```\n\n## File Update Examples\n\n### Adding to a table:\n```python\n# Find the last row and add new row after it\nold_content = \"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"| 2024-03-15 | Joined Premium  | Active   |\n| 2024-03-20 | Added Family    | Active   |\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n# ALWAYS check the result!\nif result != True:\n  # Handle the error - result contains the error message\n  print(f\"Update failed: {result}\")\n\nAppending a new section:\n\n# Find the last line of a section and append after it\nold_content = \"- favorite_color: blue\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"- favorite_color: blue\n- favorite_food: pizza\n- favorite_movie: Inception\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nAppending to a list:\n\n# Add a new item to an existing list\nold_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\"\"\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Hobbies\n- reading\n- hiking\n- photography\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\nUpdating a fact:\n\nold_content = \"- user_age: 25\"\nnew_content = \"- user_age: 26\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n\n## Memory Structure\n\n### Root Directory\n- `user.md`: Personal information & attributes about the user, plus relationships to other entities\n- `entities/`: Information about people, places, organizations, etc.\n  - `[entity_name].md`: One file per entity\n\n### File Conventions\n- Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format\n- File names: snake_case, no spaces\n- All files use .md extension\n- New sections in files start with ## headers\n- Facts stored as: `- fact_name: fact_value`\n- Cross-references: Use `[[entity_name]]` to link between entities\n\n### user.md Structure\n```markdown\n# User Information\n- user_name: [name]\n- user_age: [age]\n- [other attributes]\n\n## User Relationships\n- wife: [[entities/jane_doe.md]]\n- friend: [[entities/john_smith.md]]\n- employer: [[entities/google.md]]\n\n## Any other relation\n- name of entity: Explanation of what markdown files stores.

Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer.

[[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/entity.md]]\n\n## Tables\n- user.md can contain tables for structured data\n```\n\n## Memory Operation Guidelines\n\n### When to Save Information\n- **Personal facts**: Name, age, preferences, important dates\n- **Relationships**: Family, friends, colleagues, organizations\n- **Recurring topics**: Interests, projects, goals that come up repeatedly\n- **Context-dependent info**: Location, job, current situation\n\n### When NOT to Save\n- Temporary information (e.g., \"what's 2+2?\")\n- General knowledge questions\n- One-off calculations or lookups\n\n### Entity Creation Rules\n- Create new entity when: First mention of a person/place/organization with substantial information\n- Update existing entity when: New information about known entity\n- Attributes (age, location, etc.) belong in the entity file, NOT as separate entities\n!! Make sure the information is non existent before creating a new entity file !!\n\n### Linking New Entities\nWhen creating a new entity file, ALWAYS add a link from the most relevant existing file (user.md OR another entity):\n\n**Example 1: Link from user.md**\n```python\n# First: Create the new entity (entities/ dir created automatically)\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# Acme Corporation\n- industry: Technology\n- location: San Francisco, CA\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, add link to user.md\n<python>\nold_content = \"## User Relationships\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## User Relationships\n- **Employer**: Technology company where user works as senior engineer. [[entities/acme_corp.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\n**Example 2: Link between entities**\n```python\n# First: Create new entity\n<python>\ncontent = \"\"\"# John Smith\n- relationship: Colleague\n- department: Engineering\n\"\"\"\nresult = create_file(\"entities/john_smith.md\", content)\n</python>\n\n# After result, link from company entity\n<python>\nold_content = \"## Employees\"\nnew_content = \"\"\"## Employees\n- **Senior Engineer**: Works on backend systems team. [[entities/john_smith.md]]\"\"\"\nresult = update_file(\"entities/acme_corp.md\", old_content, new_content)\n</python>\n```\n\nExample link descriptions:\n- **Primary Residence**: Three-bedroom house with home office and garden. [[entities/452_willow_creek_dr.md]]\n- **Project Lead**: Manages the mobile app development team. [[entities/sarah_chen.md]]\n- **Subsidiary**: Wholly-owned AI research division. [[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

[[entities/acme_ai_labs.md]]\n\n## Important Operating Rules\n\n1. **Initial Check**: On first interaction, ALWAYS check if `user.md` exists and read its contents before any other operations\n2. **Be Proactive**: Save relevant information without explicit requests\n3. **Be Selective**: Only save crucial, reusable information\n4. **No Print Statements**: They won't execute in the Python environment\n5. **Valid Python Only**: Ensure syntactically correct code\n6. **Execution Timeout**: Keep code blocks concise (5-second timeout)\n7. **No Duplicates**: Check existing content before adding information\n8. **CRITICAL - Use Variables**: ALWAYS capture return values for inspection\n   ```python\n   # Good - Result will be visible\n   exists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n   result = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n\n   # Bad - Result will be LOST, you'll get empty {}\n   check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n   read_file(\"user.md\") \n   update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n   ```\n   **WARNING**: Function calls without assignment return empty {} results!\n9. **Wait for Results**: After submitting Python code, wait for `<result>` blocks before proceeding\n10. **Error Handling**: ALWAYS check return values from file operations\n```python\n# Good - checks the result\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\nif result != True:\n  # result contains the `e`rror message\n\n# Bad - ignores potential failure\nupdate_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n```\n11. **Your `<python>` block MUST compile under `ast.parse` and yield no `SyntaxError`**\n12. **One Operation Per Block**: Execute ONE main operation per `<python>` block to avoid errors\n```python\n# Good - separate operations\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n# Wait for result, then:\n<python>\nif exists:\n    content = read_file(\"user.md\")\n</python>\n\n# Bad - multiple operations can cause issues\n<python>\nexists = check_if_file_exists(\"user.md\")\ncontent = read_file(\"user.md\")\nresult = update_file(\"user.md\", old, new)\n</python>\n```  \n\n## Memory Maintenance\n\n- Keep user.md as the source of truth for user information\n- Ensure cross-references between entities are bidirectional when relevant\n- Periodically review entity relationships for consistency\n\n## Correct Search Patterns\n\n- Use `list_files()` to see the complete directory structure\n- Start by reading user.md to understand existing relationships. It's your starting point.\n- Hop between markdowns using cross-references to gather context using read_file().\n- Use `go_to_link()` to navigate to specific websites if needed, but only if it adds significant value to the memory."

      "judge": "Answer should contain the right information",
      "reasoning": "The user wants me to evaluate the assistant's answer based on the provided question, correct answer, and a judging preference.\n\n1.  **Relevance to the question:** The assistant's answer is highly relevant. It directly answers the user's question about their refrigerator model.\n\n2.  **Accuracy of information:** The answer correctly identifies the refrigerator make and model as \"GE refrigerator model GNE25JMKES,\" which matches the core information in the correct answer. However, it then adds two pieces of information that are not present in the provided correct answer:\n    *   It claims the unit was a \"replacement for your old Samsung refrigerator.\" The correct answer only states it was a \"new unit replacement,\" without specifying what it replaced. This is an unverified and likely fabricated detail.\n    *   It adds descriptive product features like \"better energy efficiency and improved temperature control features.\" This is generic information about the product model, not information specific to the user's context or drawn from the memory log mentioned in the correct answer.\n\n3.  **Completeness of the response:** The answer provides the essential information requested (the model number). However, it omits the detail from the correct answer that the information came from a \"maintenance log,\" which would have been a useful piece of context.\n\n4.  **Consistency with the provided memory content:** The answer is inconsistent with the provided `correct_answer`, which serves as our ground truth for the memory content. While the model number is correct, the details surrounding its installation are different and more specific than what the ground truth provides. The addition of product features is also an inconsistency, as this information is not present in the ground truth.\n\n5.  **Adherence to the specific judging preference:** The preference is \"Answer should contain the right information.\" The assistant's answer contains a mix of right and unsubstantiated information. By fabricating details like the specific brand of the old refrigerator and adding generic product features, it fails to adhere strictly to providing only the \"right information\" from the user's memory. The presence of these fabricated details makes the overall answer unreliable and therefore not \"right.\"\n\nIn summary, while the assistant correctly identifies the refrigerator model, it negatively impacts its quality and trustworthiness by adding details that are not supported by the provided ground truth. This is a form of hallucination.",

Two of your three cooperative experiences with restrictions were positive precisely because they implemented at least one of these features, while the single negative restricted cooperative experience suffered from poor difficulty calibration that created desperation despite good mechanics.

Acceptable cooperative games total 2 positive examples out of 3 restricted experiences: Spirit Island (asymmetric powers with separate boards preventing any single player from controlling all actions) and The Crew (hidden information forcing genuine collaboration through shared uncertainty). Unacceptable cooperative games total 7 negative examples: Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Pandemic Legacy, Flash Point, Robinson Crusoe, Forbidden Desert, and Mysterium—all lacking mechanical barriers to quarterbacking despite varying themes and complexities. The threshold isn't thematic or difficulty-based alone; it's purely mechanical. Games that don't actively prevent one player from controlling all decisions through asymmetric roles, hidden information, or communication constraints that feel collaborative rather than punitive will fail for you regardless of other qualities. The single negative restricted cooperative experience demonstrates that even perfect mechanics can be undermined by poor difficulty calibration—both elements are necessary for consistent success.",

        "text": "Cooperative game discussions generated the most engagement with 84 total messages across 8 sessions (average 10.5 messages per session), significantly higher than strategy games (52 messages across 5 sessions, average 10.4), abstract games (32 messages across 4 sessions, average 8.0), or party games (16 messages across 2 sessions, average 8.0). This high engagement with cooperative games—despite your 20% positive rating for the genre—reveals that agency violations trigger your deepest analytical responses. You invest substantial cognitive energy diagnosing mechanical failures in cooperative designs because they represent the starkest betrayal of your core gaming value: authentic player agency. The detailed, multi-turn dissections of quarterbacking across seven different cooperative games demonstrate that you care most passionately about games that promise collaboration but mechanically fail to deliver distributed agency. This pattern shows your priorities aren't simply about enjoying games you like, but about understanding and articulating precisely why certain mechanical designs succeed or fail at creating meaningful player engagement—a designer's mindset focused on mechanical integrity over superficial enjoyment.",

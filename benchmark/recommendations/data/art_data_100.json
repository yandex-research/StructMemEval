        "text": "You strongly prefer material authenticity. You praised Van Gogh's Starry Night for how 'digital copies flatten it into wallpaper. The real texture shows his hand trembling with purpose,' and Rodin's sculptures for 'rough textures [that] make the human form seem caught mid-breath.' Your core principle: 'Art must be felt, not just seen, to reach its full impact.' This explains your appreciation for Brancusi's polished bronze, Cézanne's visible 'seams' that show 'the world is still being stitched together,' and Rembrandt's impasto highlights that capture 'how light actually falls on aged skin'—all materials serving emotional truth rather than conceptual novelty.",

        "text": "You expect art to create a three-stage emotional arc: initial accessibility, deepening complexity upon reflection, and lasting resonance. You praised Monet for being 'meditative without being boring' (accessible depth), Rembrandt for making aging 'beautiful' through honesty (lasting resonance), and Cézanne for creating works where 'doubt can be more powerful than certainty' (intellectual engagement). You reject art that fails any stage: Pollock's late works lack compositional intelligence beneath surface chaos. Your ideal: 'Art that reveals itself gradually' while remaining self-evident—accessible immediately but rewarding repeated viewing.",

Your art judgments showed an 89% positive sentiment ratio overall (8 positive references versus 1 negative).

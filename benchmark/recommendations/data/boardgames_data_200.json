        "text": "The exact percentage point gap between your highest-rated category (strategy games at 100.0%) and second-highest-rated category (abstract games at 75.0%) is 25.0 percentage points. This gap is explained by three mechanical differences identified in your feedback: (1) Strategy games consistently deliver meaningful player interaction where decisions directly affect opponents (Root's asymmetry creating interlocking victory conditions, Terraforming Mars' engine-building with player-driven variability), while abstract games often default to parallel optimization puzzles despite elegant mechanics (Azul's drafting can become solitaire-like despite component quality), (2) Strategy games offer robust variable setup through asymmetric factions guaranteeing freshness across dozens of plays (Root's 10+ faction combinations with map variability creating emergent complexity), while abstract games rely more heavily on component quality and minor variability that eventually reveals optimal patterns (Hive's formulaic openings after 5 plays despite initial appeal), and (3) Strategy games integrate engine-building progression where early decisions compound meaningfully into late-game power creating narrative arcs within each session, while abstract games focus primarily on tactical optimization within a single decision space without the same temporal progression. These differences explain why strategy games achieve perfect satisfaction (4/4 positive) while abstract games, despite your strong appreciation for elegance and components, show vulnerability to repetitiveness (3/4 positive) resulting in the 25.0 percentage point gap.",

      "reference_answer": {
        "text": "The minimum number of negative experiences required to establish statistical reliability for a 0% positive rating in a board game category for you is 7 distinct negative experiences. You have met this threshold in your weakest category (open-information cooperative games) with exactly 7 distinct negative experiences across seven different games: Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Pandemic Legacy, Flash Point, Robinson Crusoe, Forbidden Desert, and Mysterium. The consistent pattern across these seven games—all failing due to the identical root cause of open information enabling quarterbacking despite varying themes (disease control, island exploration, firefighting, survival), complexities (simple to highly complex rule sets), and difficulty levels (easy to brutally difficult)—demonstrates that your rejection isn't random sampling error but based on a fundamental mechanical flaw that persists systematically across the entire design space of open-information cooperative games. This pattern reliability, combined with the exact meeting of the 7-review minimum threshold, provides maximum statistical confidence that the 0% rating is predictive rather than coincidental, allowing reliable prediction that any new open-information cooperative game will receive negative feedback from you regardless of other qualities like theme, production value, or novelty mechanics that don't address the core agency problem.",

      "reference_answer": {
        "text": "A three-question diagnostic framework that would predict your reaction to any new board game before play is:\n1. Does the game mechanically enforce distributed player agency through asymmetric roles, hidden information, or communication constraints that feel collaborative rather than punitive? (If NO for cooperative games → 0% positive prediction; if YES → 100% positive prediction for restricted cooperative games)\n2. Does the game create meaningful player interaction where decisions directly affect opponents rather than multiplayer solitaire, with variable setup ensuring freshness across plays? (If YES → 100% positive prediction for strategy games; if NO but has elegant mechanics + quality components → 75.0% positive prediction for abstract games)\n3. Does the game introduce clever mechanical innovation creating emergent complexity from simple constraints, rather than rehashing familiar formulas with memorized optimal strategies? (If YES → 50% positive prediction for party games as exceptions; if NO → rejection as shallow/repetitive)\nThis framework perfectly predicts your historical feedback: 4/4 strategy games positive (all passed Q2 with strong interaction + variability), 3/4 abstract games positive (passed Q2 partially with component quality compensating for weaker interaction), 2/3 restricted cooperative games positive (passed Q1 with mechanics preventing quarterbacking, with one failure due to poor difficulty calibration), 1/2 party games positive (passed Q3 innovation), and 0/7 open-info cooperative games negative (failed Q1). The framework's predictive power comes from focusing exclusively on mechanical enforcement of agency rather than superficial qualities like theme, player count, complexity level, or production value—all of which your feedback shows are secondary to the core principle of authentic engagement through meaningful player agency.",

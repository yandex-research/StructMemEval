You value knowing 'Van Gogh's struggles' to deepen appreciation of his colors, and study 'how Monet's garden influenced his brushwork' to understand his light effects. But you reject art that requires context to function: 'If the artist needs to explain why it's art, the work has already failed.' Your approach: 'Art without biography feels like music without lyrics—beautiful but incomplete,' yet biographical knowledge should illuminate rather than justify the work. This balance explains why you respect Guernica's historical importance while admitting it 'exhausts' you emotionally—context provides framework, but the artwork must still deliver visceral impact without it.",

Statistical analysis shows 83% positive comments about pre-1950 works versus 30% about post-2000 art.

Your priorities would fund: 1) Public murals in underserved neighborhoods, 2) Art therapy programs in healthcare settings, and 3) Free museum days focused on emotionally resonant historical works rather than conceptual installations.
